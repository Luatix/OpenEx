## Introduction

OpenEx is an open source platform allowing organizations to plan, schedule and conduct crisis exercises as well as adversary simulation campaign. OpenEx is an [ISO 22398](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50294) compliant product and has been designed as a modern web application including a RESTFul API and an UX oriented frontend.

## Objective

The goal is to create a powerful, reliable and open source tool to effectively plan and play all types of training, exercises and simulation from the technical level to the strategic one. The need for rationalization and capitalization from one year to the next, as well as the publication of ISO 22398: 2013 standard necessarily lead to the need to acquire specific software. 

OpenEx aims to respond to these issues, which not only concern state services but also many private organizations. With different modules (scenarios, teams, simulations, verification of means of communication, encryption, etc.), the platform offers advantages such as collaborative work, real-time monitoring, statistics or the management of feedback.

Finally, OpenEx supports different types of inject, allowing the tool to be integrated with emails, SMS platforms, social medias, alarm systems, etc. All currently supported integration can be found in the [OpenEx ecosystem](https://filigran.notion.site/OpenEx-Ecosystem-30d8eb73d7d04611843e758ddef8941b).

## Editions of the platform

OpenEx platform has 2 different editions: Community (CE) and Enterprise (EE). The purpose of the Enterprise Edition is to provide [additional and powerful features](https://filigran.io/offering/subscribe) which require specific investments in research and development. You can enable the Enterprise Edition directly in the settings of the platform.

* OpenEx Community Edition, licensed under the [Apache 2, Version 2.0 license](LICENSE).
* OpenEx Enterprise Edition, licensed under the [Non-Commercial license](LICENSE).

To understand what OpenEx Enterprise Edition brings in terms of features, just check the [Enterprise Editions page](https://filigran.io/offering/subscribe) on the Filigran website. You can also try this edition by enabling it in the settings of the platform.
